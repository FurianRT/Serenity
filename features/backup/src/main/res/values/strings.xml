    <string name="backup_popular_question_1_title">How does synchronization with Google Drive work</string>

    <string name="backup_popular_question_2_title">Where are my notes stored in Google Drive?</string>
    <string name="backup_popular_question_2_answer">Your notes are stored in a hidden app-specific folder in your Google Drive, which means they won’t appear in your regular Drive file list. This folder is private and only accessible by you—no one else, including the app developer, has access to your notes</string>
    <string name="backup_popular_question_3_title">Do I need a Google account to use synchronization</string>

    <string name="backup_popular_question_7_title">Is my data secure</string>

    <string name="backup_popular_question_8_title">What happens if I change my Google account</string>
    <string name="backup_popular_question_8_answer">If you switch to a different Google account, your notes from the previous account won’t be available. To access them, you need to switch back to the original Google account</string>
